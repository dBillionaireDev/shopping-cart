## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt to implement my coding knowledge of react, react hooks, especially useState and useEffect, component life cycle and version control using Git.


### Continued development

I will continue by building a full e-commerce site from descriptions, to filters to sortings and all with real-time updates.

### Useful resources

- [HuXn Webdev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O5AjEFzKw&list=PLSDeUiTMfxW6nMcmZPUG4SgFPAlazWB_S&index=6) - This helped me for everything. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. Apparently the best React tutorial out there.
